CppFT: C++ Feature Testing
==========================

Abstract
--------

This is a library approximation of the WG21 proposal N3694 
"[Feature-testing recommendations for C++](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3694.htm)"
by Clark Nelson.

The actual data on support comes from [C++ Compilers standard conformance comparison](http://www.italiancpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CppISO-Feb2014-r1.pdf)
by Raffaele Rialdi (Twitter @raffaeler).

Initial implementation is derived from [Mach7](http://bit.ly/Mach7) library, 
that had to reinvent the wheel as everyone else had to before Clark decided 
to put the proposal up.

Feel free to add/modify data on any other compilers you know.
